Class registration is happening right now. The procedure at NTU is a little different than I'm used to, but so far I haven't run into too much trouble. The university gives you a couple days to choose and prioritize your classes, then takes an afternoon to assign those classes to students. I'd like to look into this further from a programming perspective, assignment of classes to a large student population based on their prioritization is an interesting problem. Here are the classes I selected:

I chose 11 classes because I can drop as many as I'd like without consequences. Any arrangement of these classes would make for a decent semester, though I would really like to take financial management course (it meets some of the graduation criteria for my business program back home at a lower cost). Depending on the timing and intensity of my Chinese language course, I'll likely end up taking either four or five courses.

Of the 11 classes I chose, there were two with requirements I don't meet (seminar on international human right law and selected topics on international trade law). Both of those courses looked really interesting, so I'm disappointed that I was unable to have the chance to take them. Apparently, if I show up in the first week I can try to convince the professor to let me in by giving me some secret code. I might try this if they don't overlap with the other courses I'm in.

Most of the other exchange students seem to be taking courses relevant to their majors back home. I took the opposite approach. If I'm going to be living in a new country, learning a new language, doing new things, then I might as well take new classes. The content of these courses also interests me far more than any of the business courses I could have taken. I've always been interested in philosophy, so being able to skip all the introductory courses and take the equivalent of 300-400 level courses right away is enticing.

The schedule of these classes will end up playing a big role in how my semester goes. For example, a four day weekend gives me a lot more opportunity to explore Taiwan and the surrounding countries than a two or three day weekend. Evening classes could easily interfere with extracurricular activities that I plan to do, or meetings with friends. Morning classes could prevent me from staying out late. The classes I selected are all on Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday, with one or two on Monday. Hopefully, my schedule will mostly be morning and afternoon classes in the middle of the week.

I will update this post once the first round of registrations is out.
