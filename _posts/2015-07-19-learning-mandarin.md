One of the most important ways I'm preparing for my exchange is by learning Chinese. If I travel to Taiwan without any language skills I will have trouble connecting with locals and simply being independent. I have also wanted to learn Mandarin for a long time as I feel it is a useful language; it opens up a lot of opportunities for me internationally. Several weeks ago I started using language tapes and Anki to get started.

Applied linguistics has always interested me. There is so much misinformation out there regarding language acquisition, it can really throw off new learners. This post will give a light overview of the methods I'm using to study Mandarin and my primary areas of focus. This isn't a guide for other learners, it's simply what works for me. Part of this is drawn from my experience learning Japanese and partly from other sources.

For the first few months, I've chosen to focus exclusively on speaking and listening. Writing is difficult for me, I don't have the focus to sit down and actually practice it (memorization is not my strong suit). If learning to write Mandarin is as difficult as learning kanji in Japanese, I'm going to have some serious struggles in the next few months.

One thing that worked well for me in the past were [Pimsleur](http://www.pimsleur.com/) language tapes. I really do believe that they can provide a solid foundation in whichever language you choose to learn. There is a clear business/tourism theme (they will go over the words for hotel very early on, for example), but most of the material is valuable and directly applicable. It is also a fairly extensive program, developed to be completed over the course of 90 days at 30 minutes a day. I'm coming up on about 30 days now, I may start doing two lessons a day to expedite my learning later on.

The other tool that I'm using is [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/), a spaced repetition flashcard program. Without Anki, I would have never come as far as I have in Japanese. There are a couple ways to use Anki when learning a new language. The most obvious method is using it to drill vocabulary. The next method is drilling sentences. This caught on in popularity a number of years back among the Japanese language community (the 10,000 sentences method), and I think it is fairly useful. The final method is a bit newer, and basically involves a lot of cloze tests.

I'm using the sentences method. I hate drilling vocabulary, and while I think that cloze tests are likely more effective, it also requires a lot more effort to create decks. I'm lazy - I just downloaded a big deck of sentences (with audio) and work on some of those every day. I'll almost certainly never get through the entire deck, but it's a mountain that I can at least attempt to scale.

Turns out, it really is easier to learn language number three. When I was starting Japanese, I felt completely in over my head. Starting Mandarin, I have a much clearer picture of where I would like to be and how to get there. I feel like I'm learning more quickly, and I'm having more fun when I learn. Overall, I'm really enjoying learning Mandarin and having a goal that I can work towards every day. I'm hoping this will keep up at least until I leave at the end of August!
